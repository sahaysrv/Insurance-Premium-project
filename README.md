# 🧮 Insurance Cost Prediction - Regression Analysis

This project demonstrates the use of **regression modeling** to predict insurance charges based on various customer features such as age, BMI, smoking status, and region. It serves as a hands-on example of applying machine learning to real-world tabular data.

## 📊 Project Overview

The goal is to build a regression model that can estimate a person's medical insurance cost using demographic and health-related factors. The project includes:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering
- Linear Regression and Regularization Techniques
- Model Evaluation and Interpretation
